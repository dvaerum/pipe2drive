summary: Pipe your data to Google Drive
description: |
  If you pipe data (doesn't matter what data) to this program and then select a name for that data and declare it size, it will be uploaded to Google Drive.
  pipe2drive is a simple program I wrote for myself, because I wanted a way to create a tarball of my files and upload them to Google Drive without having to store the tarball on my system. I didn't want to store the tarball on my system because that would require around as much free space as the data itself, since it wasn't compressible.
